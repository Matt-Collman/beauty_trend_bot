### The Big Change: From Black to Highlights  

After two years of solid black hair, I was craving a fresh, sun-kissed look that feels modern and effortless. I decided to go for subtle balayage highlights to add dimension without a drastic change. The process was surprisingly gentle, thanks to my talented colorist, but the real work began afterward â€” maintaining my new look and keeping my hair healthy.

### Step 1: Post-Color Care â€” The First Week  

The first week after highlights is crucial. Your hair cuticles are more open, making it prone to dryness and color fading. Here's what I did:  

- **Use a Sulfate-Free Shampoo & Conditioner**: I opted for the **Olaplex No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo** and **No.5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner**. Theyâ€™re gentle, sulfate-free, and help reinforce weakened bonds, ensuring my highlights stay vibrant longer.  

- **Cold Water Rinse**: I always rinse my hair with cold water after washing. It seals the cuticles, locking in color and boosting shine.  

- **Avoid Over-Washing**: I reduced washing to 2-3 times a week to prevent color from fading. Dry shampoo is my best friend here â€” I love **Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo** for a fresh, matte finish.  

- **Deep Conditioning Treatments**: I incorporated a weekly mask, like the **Olaplex No. 8 Bond Intense Moisture Mask**, to restore moisture and keep my hair silky smooth.

### Step 2: Daily Routine & Maintenance Tips  

Once the initial week passed, I established a routine to keep my highlights looking fresh and healthy:  

- **Use Color-Depositing Products**: To prevent my highlights from becoming dull, I started using a purple-tinted conditioner once a weekâ€”**Redken Color Extend Blondage Conditioner** is great for toning and brightening.  

- **Heat Styling Smartly**: I limit heat styling to prevent damage. When I do use my curling iron or straightener, I apply a heat protectant like **GHD Heat Protect Spray** or **Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Heat Styling Spray**.  

- **Serums & Oils**: To combat dryness and add shine, I love **Ouai Miracle Hair Serum**. A little goes a long way in keeping my hair smooth and glossy.  

- **UV Protection**: Sun exposure can cause highlights to fade. I use **Color WOW Color Security Shampoo & Conditioner** for UV protection, and I wear hats or scarves on sunny days.

### Step 3: Long-Term Care & Color Refreshing  

Every 8-12 weeks, I visit my colorist for a gloss or toner to keep my highlights vibrant and fresh. I also try to extend the lifespan of my highlights with these tips:  

- **Use a Color-Enhancing Shampoo**: Switching between my regular shampoo and a color-enhancing one helps maintain brightness. I rotate with **Redken Color Extend Magnetics Shampoo**.  

- **Avoid Chlorine & Saltwater**: Chlorine can turn highlights greenish or dull. I swim with a leave-in conditioner like **Ion Swim Care Leave-In Conditioner** to create a barrier.  

- **Regular Trims**: Split ends can make hair look dull. I schedule trims every 8-10 weeks to keep my hair healthy and the highlights looking sharp.
